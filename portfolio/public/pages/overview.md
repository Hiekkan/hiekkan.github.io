# Overview

Hello 😊, my name is Nora, and I work as a SharePoint Developer at Swiss Post. 📯

&nbsp;

I enjoy tinkering with my server and smart home. 👩🏼‍💻 In addition to my development work, I have
a passion for watching arthouse movies and playing video games with friends. You can often find me
at metal concerts. 🤘🏻

&nbsp;

Currently, I'm pursuing studies in Interaction Design to deepen my understanding of UI/UX design.
I believe this expertise will enhance my abilities as a developer. 💪🏼
