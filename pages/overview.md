# Overview

Hello 😊 I'm Nora, a SharePoint Developer at Swiss Post. 📯

&nbsp;

I enjoy tinkering with my server and smart home setup. 👩🏼‍💻 Apart from coding, I’m a big movie buff who loves discovering new films. 🎬
I also like playing video games with friends and going to metal concerts. 🤘🏻

&nbsp;

Currently, I'm pursuing studies in Interaction Design to deepen my understanding of UI/UX design, believing this expertise will further enhance my skills as a developer. 💪🏼
