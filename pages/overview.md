# Overview

Hello 😊, my name is Nora, and I work as a SharePoint Developer at Swiss Post. 📯

&nbsp;

I enjoy tinkering with my server and smart home. 👩🏼‍💻 When I'm not coding, I’m deeply into films and enjoy finding and watching new movies.🎬
I also enjoy playing video games with friends and going to metal concerts. 🤘🏻

&nbsp;

Currently, I'm pursuing studies in Interaction Design to deepen my understanding of UI/UX design, believing this expertise will further enhance my skills as a developer. 💪🏼
